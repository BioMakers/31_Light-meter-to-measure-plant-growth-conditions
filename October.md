### 16th October

Cambridge - at bench 11am, full sun, 37k lux. 

Max on this day in Fenwick was 1800 lux, but this was about 4 hours before hurricane Ophelia arrived, so that might be a bit different. Apparently it was quite dark both in Fenwick and in Ireland where I also have friends. The Hurricane arrived in Ireland and then was heading to Fenwick next. It missed us.
