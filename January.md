In January it is about 2000 Lux outside in Cambridge. 

The light intensity inside does not seem to be very different, but because the weather it much worse we spend a lot more time in indoor light than in outdoor light. Indoors at my computer is still consistently 30 lux, and I have bought a halogen standard lamp with a 300w bulb that can produce 600 Lux.
