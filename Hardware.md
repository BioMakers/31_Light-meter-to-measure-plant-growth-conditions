## Hardware

Explain how the hardware components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, including a short description of fabrication and assembly. Component suppliers and part numbers should be provided separately in a bill of materials, in a 'Hardware Folder'.</p><p>

The light sensor measures from 0 to 100,000 lux, which is a very good range for measuring from the darkest room in a house to the brightest day outside.

Here are some initial images of the hardware. These will be replaced with better ones once the images are ready.
