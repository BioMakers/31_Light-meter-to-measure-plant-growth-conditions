## Winter's arrived

The whole point of this project is to figure out how to get enough light to stay healthy in the winter, so the arrival of November 
is a bit of a turning point.

With my measurements this month I'm realising that the sunshine is out there and I'm just not getting it because the weather is 
very cold so I'm not getting outside much. For people with office jobs, this is also a tricky time, as the strong sunshine is only available in the middle
of the day, when those people cannot get outside. 

Anyway, for me, it the cold that makes the difference. I'm acting on this by changing tack a bit and looking into warmer clothes. This is a trickier proposition than it sounds, since there
is a strong cultural expectation on women to look slim, which is not really compatible with being warm. 
So I'm looking into clothing technology to figure out how to pull off warm and slim at the same time. It turns out that brands 
like Rohan take this stuff quite seriously and there are other technologies like "thermogen" that are built for this. 

Anyway - I'm on the case.
